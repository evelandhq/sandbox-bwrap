# @evelandhq/sandbox-bwrap

A [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)-based `SandboxBackend` for
[eve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eve) agents. It gives agent-executed code a real
Linux sandbox — actual binaries, isolated filesystem, coarse network control — without
requiring a Docker daemon or KVM.

## Why

eve's built-in backend chain is Vercel → Docker → microsandbox → just-bash. On a
self-hosted Linux box without a Docker daemon or KVM (for example an eveland systemd
deployment host), that chain bottoms out at `just-bash`: a pure-JS interpreter with a
virtual filesystem that cannot run real binaries. This backend fills that gap with
bubblewrap, which needs nothing but the `bwrap` binary and unprivileged user
namespaces.

## Usage

**Deployed on eveland:** you do nothing. eveland's Docker and systemd runtimes generate
the sandbox module into the release directory at build time — `agent/sandbox.js` for a flat
agent, or `agent/sandbox/sandbox.js` when a sandbox folder exists, recursively for every
subagent — and vendors this package's built output beside it, so agent projects never declare
a deployment backend themselves. If a project shipped its own sandbox module, the build
replaces that definition and reports it in the build log; authored `bootstrap()` and
`onSession()` behavior is not used. The sibling `agent/sandbox/workspace/**` tree is preserved,
so Eve still seeds those files into each Session's `/workspace`. Each Eveland Release supplies a
distinct template revision, so Sessions created against a new Deployment see its updated seeds
while existing durable Session workspaces remain untouched. The systemd runtime invokes
bwrap as its unprivileged deployment user. The local Docker runtime installs bwrap inside the Agent
image and grants the outer container only the capabilities nested bwrap requires; the
Agent container still receives no Docker socket. Local `eve dev` is untouched — it never runs
the eveland build pipeline, so it falls back to eve's default backend chain (usually
`just-bash`, or Docker where available). See eveland's `docs/deploy/linux.md` for what the
build log looks like and what happens when the sandbox does not work on the host.

**Standalone use of this package** (outside eveland, or in any project that manages its
own `agent/sandbox.ts`) still works the manual way:

```ts
// agent/sandbox.ts
import { defineSandbox, defaultBackend } from "eve/sandbox";
import { bwrap, isBwrapAvailable } from "@evelandhq/sandbox-bwrap";

export default defineSandbox({
  // bwrap on the Linux deploy host; eve's default chain everywhere else (dev laptops).
  backend: () => (isBwrapAvailable() ? bwrap() : defaultBackend()),
});
```

### eve version requirement

This package requires `eve` `>=0.27.0 <1.0.0`.

The range is deliberately wide. eve's 0.x releases use caret-incompatible minor bumps,
so a package that pins a narrow window has to republish for every eve minor — which is
churn for consumers, not safety, when the surface actually consumed is one small
interface (`SandboxBackend` from `eve/sandbox`) that changes rarely. Rather than
re-declaring the window, CI keeps the claim honest from both ends:
`src/eve-compatibility.test.ts` typechecks the backend against the range's exact floor
(0.27.13) and the newest verified release on every run, and a scheduled workflow re-runs
the suite against `eve@latest` so a breaking eve minor shows up as a red build here
instead of a bug report from your deployment. That is not theoretical: eve 0.32.0 added a
required `stop()` to the backend handle. This package implements it; 0.1.0 does not, and
pairing that release with eve `>=0.32.0` resolves cleanly and then fails at runtime the
first time authored code calls `ctx.getSandbox().stop()`.

The backend implements both handle lifecycle methods by killing every process the session
has spawned that has not yet exited: `shutdown()`, which eve calls at server teardown and
which requires that nothing be left running afterwards, and `stop()`, which authored code
triggers mid-run through `ctx.getSandbox().stop()`. Backends with provider-side compute
distinguish the two — a container to pause, a VM to snapshot; bwrap has no such resource,
because the processes are the compute. Neither method touches the session's workspace
directory — it is durable state, and remains available when the session reattaches or the
next callback reopens it.

## How it works

- **prewarm** (build time): runs the authored `bootstrap` inside bwrap against a
  staging directory, resolves Eve's `$HOME/.agents/skills/**` seed paths to
  `/workspace/.agents/skills/**`, writes seed files, then atomically renames it into
  `<cacheDir>/templates/<hash>` (`<cacheDir>` defaults to
  `<appRoot>/.eve/sandbox-cache/bwrap` when the `cacheDir` option is not set). Idempotent
  per template key + options hash; `templateRevision` participates in that hash.
- **create** (runtime): clones the template into `<cacheDir>/sessions/<hash>` on first
  use. The directory IS the durable session state: it persists across reconnects and
  process restarts.
- **run/spawn**: every command is one transient bwrap invocation —
  read-only host rootfs, the session directory bound read-write at `/workspace`,
  tmpfs `/tmp`, PID/IPC/UTS namespaces unshared, `--die-with-parent`.
  `run()` also applies `runTimeoutMs` and kills the entire detached process group
  when the deadline or caller AbortSignal fires; `spawn()` remains unbounded until
  its holder calls `kill()`, the Session is stopped, or the backend shuts down.
- **File I/O** (`readTextFile`, `writeFile`, …): host-side operations on the session
  directory; no subprocess. Writes outside `/workspace` are refused.

## Disk usage and cache management

Session and template directories persist indefinitely under
`<cacheDir>/{sessions,templates}` across process restarts and reconnects, enabling fast
reattach when a session resumes. Each session key gets a directory that is reused for
the lifetime of the session; each template is cached per (template key, options hash), with
an optional release revision in the options hash,
and reused across sessions. This backend intentionally does not prune either — its
`stop()` and `shutdown()` methods only kill the session's live processes and leave the
workspace on disk, so reattach is instant and stateless from the agent's perspective. On a long-lived
host, this means the cache will grow with the number of durable sessions and unique
templates, consuming disk space indefinitely. On eveland deployments this cache lives at
`EVELAND_SANDBOX_CACHE_DIR` (one subdirectory per project), outside every release
directory, precisely so that redeploying a project does not touch it.

Reclaiming space today requires manual intervention: identify which sessions are known dead and delete their corresponding directories under the cache root. Automatic cache pruning (e.g., based on age or LRU) is a known gap and a planned follow-up.

## Security boundary

- The host process environment is **never** forwarded: every invocation uses
  `--clearenv` and rebuilds the environment from `PATH`, `HOME=/workspace`, `LANG`,
  plus your configured `env`. Deployment secrets in the agent's `process.env` stay
  out of sandboxed code.
- For code executed inside the sandbox (`run`/`spawn`), the cache root (all
  other sessions and templates of the app) is hidden behind a tmpfs, so
  sandboxed code cannot read sibling session state.
- The host-side read methods (`readFile`, `readBinaryFile`, `readTextFile`)
  are deliberately **not** containment-checked: eve's contract requires
  absolute paths to pass through to the host filesystem unchanged, so these
  calls can read anything the agent process itself can read — including a
  sibling session's files or a template directory — not just paths inside
  `/workspace`. Only the write and remove calls (`writeFile`, `writeTextFile`,
  `writeBinaryFile`, `removePath`) are confined to the workspace, via the
  realpath-aware check described below. In other words, the tmpfs above is a
  boundary against a _sandboxed process_, not a boundary between sessions of
  the same agent — all of an app's sessions and templates share one trust
  domain on the host.
- The rest of the host filesystem is _visible read-only_ to sandboxed code, and the
  sandbox shares the host kernel. This is protection against mistakes and prompt
  injection — not multi-tenant isolation. If untrusted tenants or code that routinely
  handles customer credentials must run here, move to VM-level isolation
  (Firecracker/microsandbox) instead of hardening this backend further.
  Under Eveland's local Docker runtime, "host filesystem" here means the outer Agent
  container's filesystem, not the Docker host; no host root or Docker socket is mounted.
- CPU, memory, and PID limits are inherited from whatever cgroup the agent runs in
  (on eveland, the deployment's Docker container or systemd unit covers sandbox
  children too). The backend adds only the `run()` wall-clock deadline; it does not
  create a per-command cgroup or impose resource quotas on `spawn()`.
- Host-side write/remove calls (`writeFile`, `writeTextFile`, `writeBinaryFile`,
  `removePath`) verify containment with a realpath-aware check
  (`isWithinWorkspaceReal`): they resolve symlinks along the path and re-check that
  the real target still lands inside the real session directory, closing the escape
  where sandboxed code plants a symlink inside `/workspace` pointing outside it and a
  later host-side write follows it out. A race between that check and the filesystem
  call it guards remains theoretically possible — Node exposes no
  `RESOLVE_BENEATH`/`O_NOFOLLOW`-atomic primitive to close it — so treat this as a
  containment check against planted symlinks, not an atomic guarantee.
- Symlink resolution cannot see inode aliasing. On the kernel this backend has been
  tested against (Ubuntu 24.04, aarch64), creating a hard link from inside the
  sandbox to a file outside `/workspace` (`ln <host file> /workspace/x`) was
  **refused** — the kernel rejected the hard link across the two bind mounts. The
  integration contract test prints this as a non-assertive probe
  (`HARDLINK PROBE: refused …` or `succeeded …`) rather than an assertion, because
  the outcome depends on kernel/filesystem behavior this package does not control.
  Do not treat hard-link rejection as a guarantee the backend enforces — verify it on
  your own kernel if it matters to your threat model.

## Requirements

Eveland's generated local Docker image installs `bubblewrap` and `bash`, creates
`/workspace`, and starts the outer Agent container with its default capability set
dropped, `SYS_ADMIN` and `NET_ADMIN` added for bwrap namespaces, `no-new-privileges`,
and `seccomp=unconfined`. This is a local-development boundary; the supported Linux
production topology uses the unprivileged systemd path below.

- Linux with unprivileged user namespaces available to the calling process. Ubuntu's
  packaged bubblewrap (0.9.0-1ubuntu0.1 on 24.04) ships **no** AppArmor profile. Since
  Ubuntu sets `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` by default, an
  _unconfined non-root_ process calling `bwrap` fails with
  `bwrap: setting up uid map: Permission denied` unless the host loads an AppArmor
  profile that grants `bwrap` the `userns` permission. Root is unaffected by this
  sysctl, but nothing here runs as root: eveland's systemd runtime runs both this
  backend (as the deployment user) and its own build sandbox (as a separate,
  unprivileged build user) as unconfined non-root userns creators, so both need the
  same AppArmor grant. Save this as `/etc/apparmor.d/bwrap`:

  ```
  abi <abi/4.0>,
  include <tunables/global>

  profile bwrap /usr/bin/bwrap flags=(unconfined) {
    userns,

    # Site-specific additions and overrides. See local/README for details.
    include if exists <local/bwrap>
  }
  ```

  then load it with `apparmor_parser -r -W /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap` (safe to re-run; it
  replaces an already-loaded profile). A distro whose bubblewrap package ships its own
  profile, or a host with the sysctl disabled, needs none of this.

- `/workspace` must pre-exist on the host as an empty directory. `bwrap` binds each
  session directory onto `/workspace` inside the sandbox but cannot create that mount
  destination itself, because the host root is bind-mounted read-only first
  (`bwrap: Can't mkdir /workspace: Read-only file system`). If it is missing, the
  backend fails fast with an actionable error message before invoking `bwrap` (see
  `describeMissingPrereqs` in `src/process.ts`).
- `bash` and (for agents that need it) `node` on the host PATH — the sandbox reuses
  the host rootfs read-only.
- Works under systemd hardening (`NoNewPrivileges=yes`, `ProtectSystem=strict`):
  apt's `bwrap` is not setuid, so it needs no privilege escalation to run — but it
  still needs the AppArmor profile above to create a user namespace as an
  unprivileged user.

## Testing

- `pnpm test` — unit tests, run anywhere, including macOS (process execution is
  injectable; no bwrap and no Linux needed). This is what CI runs on every push, and it
  includes the eve floor/latest compatibility typechecks.
- `bash infra/smoke.sh` — the contract test against **real** bwrap, on macOS or Linux.
  It provisions a Lima VM (`brew install lima`), streams this worktree in, and runs the
  test as an unprivileged user under the systemd hardening a deployed eve agent actually
  gets — `NoNewPrivileges=yes`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `PrivateTmp=yes`. Prints
  `BWRAP SMOKE OK`. Run this before pushing anything that touches `src/args.ts` or
  `src/process.ts`: CI's smoke job covers the unprivileged-user case but not the systemd
  constraints, and argv that looks right is not the same as a kernel that accepts it.
- `pnpm tsx src/integration/bwrap-backend-smoke.ts` — the same test, run directly. Needs
  a Linux host that already has the AppArmor profile loaded and `/workspace` created
  (see [Requirements](#requirements)), and should be run as an unprivileged user: root
  is exempt from the userns sysctl, so a root-only pass proves nothing about a real
  deployment.
